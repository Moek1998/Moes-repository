Is my bot password safe?

Yes. We do not store bot and SmartBots account passwords on a sandbox server at all.

Can scripts read files?

No. The scripts are sandboxed and can't access world outside the sandbox. However, check the "Bug Hunter" program below.

Can I crash the server?

Yes, easily. Just write the script which starts a dead loop. During the beta test we don't track and kill such scripts (we will later). So... just act wisely.

Can other users access my scripts?

Nobody can. However, check the [our Bug Hunter program](https://www.mysmartbots.com/dev/docs/Bot_Playground/Bug_Hunter_program "Bot Playground/Bug Hunter program").

## Selling your scripts

When someone my Playground script, do they have an access to the source code?

No by default. You can set "show sources to the buyer" tho.
