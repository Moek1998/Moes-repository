# Bot Store script releases - SmartBots Developers Docs


When you sell your script at Bot Store, you sell a specific release. Consider it a "script version".

At lease one (first) release is required. However, you may want to update, bug-fix and update your already-existing script. To do this, you keep the script development and eventually do a next release.

Each release has the following info associated:

*   Release version
*   Internal name (only you see it)
*   Public details (for example, the list of bugs fixed)
*   Script permissions (read more about [permissions](https://www.mysmartbots.com/dev/docs/Bot_Playground/Store/Permissions "Bot Playground/Store/Permissions"))
*   User settings (read more about [user settings](https://www.mysmartbots.com/dev/docs/Bot_Playground/Store/User_settings "Bot Playground/Store/User settings"))

### Release version

Release version consists of three parts ("00.00.000") - major version, minor version and build number. You can increase them in the way you want. The only requirement is that version number of a new release has to be greater than a previous one.

There's no way to rollback the release. Instead, you create a new release.

## Existing script users

Once you release a script update, each user (buyer) of your script will get an invitation to install this update.
