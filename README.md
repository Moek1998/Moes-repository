# Flickr Auto-Like Program

A Python program that automatically likes photos on Flickr containing the word "Muneca" (or any other specified keywords).

## Features

- üîç **Smart Search**: Search for photos by keywords in titles, descriptions, and tags
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Auto-Like**: Automatically like photos matching your criteria
- üîê **OAuth Authentication**: Secure authentication with Flickr API
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: Extensive configuration options for search and behavior
- ÔøΩ **Progress Tracking**: Keeps track of liked photos to avoid duplicates
- ÔøΩÔ∏è **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits with configurable delays
- ÔøΩ **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- ÔøΩ **Filtering**: Advanced filtering options (date range, users, tags, etc.)
- üß™ **Dry Run Mode**: Test the program without actually liking photos

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup

### 1. Get Flickr API Credentials

1. Go to [Flickr App Garden](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/)
2. Click "Request an API Key"
3. Choose "Apply for a Non-Commercial Key"
4. Fill out the form with your application details
5. You'll receive an API Key and API Secret

### 2. Configure the Program

Run the program once to generate a default configuration file:

```bash
python flickr_auto_like.py
```

This will create a `config.ini` file. Edit it with your API credentials:

```ini
[FLICKR]
api_key = your_api_key_here
api_secret = your_api_secret_here
oauth_token = 
oauth_token_secret = 

[SEARCH]
keywords = Muneca
search_in = title,description,tags
per_page = 100
max_pages = 10
sort = date-posted-desc
privacy_filter = 1
content_type = 1
media = photos

[BEHAVIOR]
max_likes_per_run = 50
delay_between_likes = 2
skip_own_photos = true
skip_already_liked = true
dry_run = false

[FILTERS]
min_upload_date = 
max_upload_date = 
exclude_users = 
required_tags = 
exclude_tags = 
```

### 3. First Run and Authentication

Run the program again after adding your API credentials:

```bash
python flickr_auto_like.py
```

The program will:
1. Open a browser window for OAuth authorization
2. Ask you to authorize the application
3. Request you to enter the verification code
4. Save the authentication tokens for future use

## Configuration Options

### FLICKR Section
- `api_key`: Your Flickr API key
- `api_secret`: Your Flickr API secret
- `oauth_token`: OAuth token (auto-generated during first run)
- `oauth_token_secret`: OAuth token secret (auto-generated during first run)

### SEARCH Section
- `keywords`: Keywords to search for (default: "Muneca")
- `search_in`: Where to search (title, description, tags)
- `per_page`: Number of photos per page (max 100)
- `max_pages`: Maximum pages to search through
- `sort`: Sort order (date-posted-desc, date-posted-asc, date-taken-desc, etc.)
- `privacy_filter`: 1 for public photos, 0 for all
- `content_type`: 1 for photos only, 2 for screenshots, 3 for other
- `media`: Type of media (photos, videos, all)

### BEHAVIOR Section
- `max_likes_per_run`: Maximum number of photos to like per run
- `delay_between_likes`: Delay in seconds between likes (to respect API limits)
- `skip_own_photos`: Whether to skip your own photos
- `skip_already_liked`: Whether to skip previously liked photos
- `dry_run`: Test mode - doesn't actually like photos

### FILTERS Section
- `min_upload_date`: Minimum upload date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `max_upload_date`: Maximum upload date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `exclude_users`: Comma-separated list of user IDs to exclude
- `required_tags`: Comma-separated list of tags that must be present
- `exclude_tags`: Comma-separated list of tags to exclude

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python flickr_auto_like.py
```

### Test Mode (Dry Run)
Set `dry_run = true` in config.ini to test without actually liking photos.

### Search for Different Keywords
Change the `keywords` in the SEARCH section:
```ini
keywords = cat cute kitten
```

### Limit by Date Range
Filter photos by upload date:
```ini
min_upload_date = 2023-01-01
max_upload_date = 2023-12-31
```

### Exclude Specific Users
```ini
exclude_users = 12345678@N00,87654321@N00
```

### Require Specific Tags
```ini
required_tags = photography,nature
```

## Files Created

The program creates several files:

- `config.ini`: Configuration file
- `flickr_auto_like.log`: Log file with program output
- `liked_photos.json`: List of previously liked photo IDs

## Logging

The program logs all activities to both the console and `flickr_auto_like.log`. Log levels include:

- **INFO**: General program flow and successful operations
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues
- **ERROR**: Critical errors that prevent operation

## Rate Limiting

The program includes built-in rate limiting to respect Flickr's API limits:

- Default 2-second delay between likes
- Configurable delay in the `delay_between_likes` setting
- Maximum likes per run to prevent overwhelming the API

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Make sure your API key and secret are correct
- Delete the oauth_token and oauth_token_secret from config.ini to re-authenticate
- Check that your app has the correct permissions

### No Photos Found
- Verify your search keywords
- Check the privacy_filter setting
- Ensure you're searching in the right time range

### API Errors
- Increase the delay_between_likes value
- Reduce max_likes_per_run
- Check your API rate limits on Flickr

## Ethical Usage

Please use this program responsibly:

- Don't spam likes on photos
- Respect other users and their content
- Follow Flickr's Terms of Service
- Use reasonable delays between actions
- Consider the impact on other users
